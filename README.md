**_From Curiosity to Capability in Quantum Machine Learning_**  
By Javier Mancilla Montero

## About the Book

**QML Unlocked** is a practical guide that bridges the gap between curiosity and capability in Quantum Machine Learning (QML). It explores fundamental quantum computing principles, real-world applications of quantum machine learning models, and hands-on Python implementations using quantum frameworks.

This repository contains accompanying **code examples**, **figures**, and **references** used in the book. If you're diving into QML, this repo will help you experiment with quantum algorithms and techniques.

## Table of Contents

The book covers a wide range of topics, including:

1. **Quantum Computing and Machine Learning**  
2. **Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) and Cloud Access**  
3. **Choosing the Right Quantum Hardware**  
4. **Implementing QML Models with Python** *(Code Available in Repo)*  
5. **The Importance of Preprocessing in QML** *(Code Available in Repo)*  
6. **Encoding Classical Data into Quantum States**  
7. **Quantum Support Vector Classifiers (QSVC)** *(Code Available in Repo)*  
8. **Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQC)** *(Code Available in Repo)*  
9. **Promising Quantum Approaches (QUBO-based SVM, Reservoir Computing, etc.)** *(Code Available in Repo)*  
10. **End-to-End Implementation of Quantum ML Solutions**  

For more details, **the full book is available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com)**.
